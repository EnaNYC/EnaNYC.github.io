I analyzed arrest data from the New York City Police Department for the year 2021. Key insights include:
- Most arrests occured on Wendesdays
- Most arrests on Saturdays and Sundays were misdemeanors, while most arrets during the weekdays were felonies
- The perpetrator profile with the most arrests were Black males aged between 25-44
